## TODO List

* Refactor EventStore to handle iterations (publications) of one event.
  (that is also init-safe)

* Refactor repo to be a collection (aggregate) of these event stores.

* Header content in subject? (or state, what is the char. limit?)

* Finish demo of collaborative store.

* Clone and build demo of chat.

* Upgrade chat to have user list and channels (room/guild).
  Will need to add channel state (member list encryption)
